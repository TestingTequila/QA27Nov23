   {
      Action over variables of the class
   }


// 3. Types Of Methods
       Global Variables: That can be used/shared by all the methods of the class
       Parameters      : Don't want to share your variables with other methods of the class, use those variables as parameters

       If we come across scenario where within the same class we have global variable name same as parameters name, in such case
       to differentiate global variable with parameter we use 'this' keyword to call global variables
       -> How to assign value of parameters to global variable

       >Global Variable-> Variables outside method within the class, can be shared by multiple methods within the class
       > Local Variable -> Variable inside the method, always assign value to it, cannot be changed while calling unlike global variables and parameters
       > Parameters -> Variable within the curved bracket of the methods, cannot be shared by other methods
       > Both global variables and parameters give variable result depending upon what value you assign
       > Use 'this' keyword to differentiate between global variable and parameters with the same name. 'this' keyword should be used to call global variables
