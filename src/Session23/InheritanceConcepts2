-Method overloading is existence of multiple methods with  the same name within the same class
-Method overriding is existence of multiple methods with same name in different classes
- In order to implement method overriding, the classes need to have parent-child relationship
-Overriding: Rules
  -Parent child relationship should exists within the classes
  -Child class should have method with same name as parent class
  -Child class method and parent class method with same names should have same parameter
  -Child class method and parent class method with same names should have the same return type

  TO check if a method is overridden or not in child class use '@Override' in the method of the child class
  -Method Overriding is also known as runtime polymorphism or Dynamic Polymorphism
  -A class cannot have more than one parent as this will lead to diamond problem.
  -Multiple inheritance among classes is not possible in Java

  TopCasting Concept:
  - For Top casting to happen among classes, they should have parent-child relationship among them
  - We can refer child class object using parent class reference variable.
  => Car [ Car car = new Car]
  => BMW [BMW bmw = new BMW()]
  => Car car= new BMW(); [ TOP CASTING]

  DownCasting Concept:
  // DownCasting
  For down casting to happen among classes, they should have parent-child relationship among them
  - We cannot refer parent class object using child class reference variable at compile in Java
  BMW bmw = new Car(); // DownCasting is not possible in Java at compile time
