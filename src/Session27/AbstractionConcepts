1. We cannot create object of an abstract method
2. We cannot create object of an interface as well.
3. An interface cannot have a constructor
4. AN ABSTRACT CLASS CAN HAVE CONSTRUCTOR
5. Child class will always call the non-parametrized (default) constructor
6. If parent class has parametrized constructor and no non-parametrized(default) constructor, the child class
   will not appreciate this[as in P-C relationship, child can call only non-parametrized(default) constructor] and will
   throw error.
   => So, in a parent class, if you have a non-parametrized constructor, please ensure you
   have a parametrized constructor created as well.
7. Top casting is possible between abstract parent class(A) and child class (C)
   A a = new C();
