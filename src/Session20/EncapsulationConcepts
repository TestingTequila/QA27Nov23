-Encapsulation in Java is the process by which (variables) and (methods) are integrated as a single unit.
-By encapsulating a class's variables, other classes cannot access them, and only the methods of the class can access them.

=> Create variables within the class and make them private so that they are not accessible in other classes

-private variable, public setter/getter method - Encapsulation
-private variable, Constructor/getter method   - Encapsulation
-private methods within public method          - Encapsulation
