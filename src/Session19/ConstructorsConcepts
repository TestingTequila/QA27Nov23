1. Constructors are responsible for assigning default values to global variables of the class.
2. The moment we create a class a default, invisible constructor is created within that class.
3. A constructor is something which is similar to that of a method.
4. How the constructor looks?
        Rules for creating Java constructor
        There are two rules defined for the constructor.
        a) Constructor name must be the same as its class name
        b) A Constructor must have no explicit return type
    ============================================================================================

    -Default constructor is called the moment we create [object] of the class.
    -At the time of calling constructor, memory for the object is allocated in the memory.
    -It calls a default constructor if there is no constructor available in the class.
     In such case, Java compiler provides a default constructor by default.
    -Every time an object is created using the new() keyword, at least one constructor is called

     Note: It is called constructor because it constructs the values at the time of object creation.
     It is not necessary to write a constructor for a class.
     It is because java compiler creates a default constructor if your class doesn't have any.
     ==========================================================================================

     => Constructors are also used to act as setters --> For setting the values of global variables
