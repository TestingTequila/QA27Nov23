1.Inheritance inherits every non-private property of the parent class
2. To inherit property of one class into other, we use the keyword 'Extends'
3. A extends B means : B is parent and A is child => B is inheriting all the non-private properties of A

Types of methods:
1. Abstract method- Just Definition with no implementation
2. Concrete Method- Has both definition and implementation

-We cannot crete object of an abstract class
- Class Vs Abstract Class Vs Interface
=> Class will have only concrete methods
=> Abstract class can have both concrete and abstract methods
=> Interface will have only abstract methods

- We cannot crete object of interface as well as Abstract class
- To inherit interface into a class we need to use the keyword - 'implements'
