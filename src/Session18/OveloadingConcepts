METHOD OVERLOADING: These are the methods with same names and different parameters

1. In a class we can have two or more methods with same name provided their parameters
   are different
   How we can make parameters different
   -By changing the data types of the parameter
   -By changing the count of parameters
   -By changing the order of parameters

2. Even if Access modifier and return type of two methods with same name and same parameters exists
   this is not an example of method overloading ans will throw error.
   To rectify this error, you need to change the parameter.


3. Method overloading is also known as Compile time polymorphism or static polymorphism
4. main method can be overloaded
