1. If there is some common property value for all the objects of the class, make it static
2. Common memory allocation is used for storing static properties of the object
3. If variable or methods are part of object, they need to be accessed through object reference variables only
4. static as we know is not part of object and hence cannot be accessed through object reference variable.
5. static variables/methods can be accessed directly through class name
6. Local variables can't be static
7. If you don't want to change the value of static variable, make it final
