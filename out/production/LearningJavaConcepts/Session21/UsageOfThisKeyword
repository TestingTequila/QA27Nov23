1. If global variable name is same as name of parameters, to differentiate between them, we use this keyword along with global variable
2. If the return type of a method is this, it means the method will return the object of the same class
   => instead of using new ClassName() as return we prefer using this keyword,
      as this will return the same object of the class rather than creating a new Object
3. To call one constructor inside other constructor, we use this keyword.
   => Constructor calling should be the first statement inside other constructor.
      You cannot call a constructor inside a method
      -> Method will be part of object and object is constructed using constructor,
         so we cannot call the constructor before creating the object
