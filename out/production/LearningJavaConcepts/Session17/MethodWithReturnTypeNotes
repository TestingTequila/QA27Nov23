1. If you use anything apart from void, in methods, use return keyword at the end the program within the method
use return keyword just above the closing curly braces of the method

2. You have to return something which has same data type as the data type of your method
3. Since the  method is returning me something, i can store that value and can perform further calculation
   and manipulation over it
