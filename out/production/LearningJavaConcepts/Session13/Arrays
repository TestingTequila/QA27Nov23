1- What are arrays
   Arrays are just like variables which are meant to store multiple values unlike variables, that can hold only
   one value at a time.

2- How to create Array

    a) dataType[] arrayName={value1, value2, value3.....valueN};
    b) dataType[] arrayName = new dataType[countOfValuesYouWishToStoreInAnArray]

3- To know the size of an array --> nameOfTheArray.length

==> Use Array only when the count of value you want to store will remain static.
    To handle dynamic addition of values, we will learn about collections ...

    Arrays + Loops
    To store multiple values use Arrays + and to perform any operation or action over the array we use, Loops
    => Arrays and Loops most of the times go together
